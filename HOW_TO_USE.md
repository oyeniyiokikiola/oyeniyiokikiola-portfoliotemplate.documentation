# How to Use This Template

## Quick Start

1. Click the green **"Use this template"** button at the top of this repository
2. Name your new repository (e.g., `customer-churn-analysis`, `sales-dashboard-project`)
3. Start filling in `README_TEMPLATE.md` — replace every placeholder with your actual project content
4. Once you're done, rename `README_TEMPLATE.md` to `README.md` in your project
5. Delete any folders you don't need
6. Delete all the comment blocks (between `<!--` and `-->`) before publishing your project

## What This Template Contains

- **README_TEMPLATE.md** — The main template. Fill this in for your project.
- **project_metadata.yml** — Machine-readable metadata (optional)
- **Folder structure** — Pre-built folders for data, notebooks, scripts, queries, reports, visuals, and docs
- **.gitignore** — Prevents you from accidentally committing data files

## Filling In the README

Every section has comment blocks that look like this:
<!--
  Instructions on what to write here.
  Examples of good vs. weak documentation.
  Delete this entire comment block before publishing.
-->
Read the comment, write your content, delete the comment.

## Which Sections to Keep vs. Delete

**Keep every time:**
- Project Overview
- Objectives  
- Scope & Tools
- Data Workflow
- Key Insights
- Recommendations
- Limitations
- Author

**Delete if not applicable:**
- ERD section (only for SQL projects with multiple tables)
- queries/ folder (if you didn't use SQL)
- notebooks/ folder (if you didn't use Jupyter or R Markdown)

## Adapting for Different Project Types

**SQL Project:** Keep queries/, visuals/, reports/. Keep ERD section.

**Python EDA:** Keep notebooks/, data/, visuals/. Skip queries/ and ERD.

**Dashboard:** Keep visuals/ (screenshots), reports/. Focus on Analysis & Metrics section.

**Data Pipeline:** Keep scripts/, queries/, docs/. Focus on Data Workflow section.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Leaving placeholder text like [Your Name] in your published README
2. Keeping empty folders you didn't use
3. Writing vague objectives like "Explore the data"
4. Skipping the limitations section
5. Forgetting to update the Author section
