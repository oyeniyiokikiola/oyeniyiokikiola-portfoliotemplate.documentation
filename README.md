# Data Project Documentation Template

A production-ready GitHub template for documenting data analysis, SQL, dashboard, pipeline, and machine learning projects - with built-in examples, narrative guidance, and adaptable structure.

## What This Is

This is a **cloneable template repository** designed to help data analysts, scientists, and engineers document their projects the way senior practitioners do - with clarity, structure, and storytelling.

Every section includes:
- Plain-language instructions on what to write
- Examples of strong vs. weak documentation  
- Guidance on when to keep or delete a section

It works for **any kind of data project:**
- SQL analysis
- Python / R exploratory analysis
- Dashboards (Tableau, Power BI, Looker)
- Data pipelines / ETL workflows
- Machine learning / predictive modeling
- Mixed-method projects

## Why This Exists

After hundreds of portfolio reviews, the pattern was clear: **the projects that stand out aren't always the most technically sophisticated - they're the ones where the README tells a clear story.**

Most data professionals never learn how to document their work. This template fixes that.

## How to Use It

1. Click **"Use this template"** (green button at the top)
2. Name your new repo after your actual project
3. Copy the contents of `README_TEMPLATE.md` into your new project's README
4. Delete folders and sections you don't need
5. Remove all placeholder text and comments before publishing

## What's Inside

The template includes:
- **README_TEMPLATE.md** - The fill-in-the-blank documentation template
- **project_metadata.yml** - Optional machine-readable metadata
- **Complete folder structure** - Pre-built folders for data, notebooks, scripts, queries, reports, visuals, and docs
- **.gitignore** - Pre-configured to exclude data files

## Who This Is For

- **Beginners** building their first portfolio project
- **Early-career analysts** cleaning up existing projects
- **Career switchers** who have technical skills but need to frame their work
- **Experienced practitioners** who want a consistent structure
